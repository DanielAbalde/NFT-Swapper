<p align="center">Trustless and self-soveraign exchange of multiple NFT</p>



## ðŸ˜Ž Overview

Most NFT platforms allow you to sell and auction NFTs using cryptos, but they do not yet allow you to exchange them for other NFTs. When you want to exchange more than one, you currently need to trust the other participant to fulfill the deal. These contracts solve this problem by being the custodian and intermediary of the exchange.
