<h1 align="center"> NFT Swapper (WIP)</h1> 
<p align="center">Peer to peer exchange of multiple NFT</p>



## ðŸ˜Ž Overview

Most NFT platforms allow you to sell and auction NFTs using cryptos, but they do not yet allow you to exchange them for other NFTs. When you want to exchange more than one, you currently need to trust even more with the other participant to fulfill the deal. These contracts solve this problem by acting as an trustless intermediary that escrows and exchanges the NFTs when both parties have deposited their part of the agreement. Official implementations have no owner or admin accounts so all activity is self sovereign.

Polygon contract: []()


## ðŸ”Œ Usage

1. Register a new exchange.
2. Both parties must approve the NFT Swapper contract in the NFT contracts to be exchanged.
3. Both parties deposit NFTs (or one of them cancels the exchange).
4. Both parties claim the NFTs.

## ðŸ”Ž Disclaimer

Use these contracts at your own risk. If you use these contracts you agree that you are legally responsible for any results. The contracts do not have admin mechanisms neither an owner, so only the participants of an exchange have the power to cancel, deposit and claim it. Be sure to use the official contract addresses listed in this document.
